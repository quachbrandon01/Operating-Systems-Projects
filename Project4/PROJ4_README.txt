Project 4 - CPU Schedulers 

To compile and run this progam(Algorithm, CPU, FCFS, RR, Priority, Task) 
code follow these steps:

1) Save Algorithm.java, CPU.java, FCFS.java, RR.java, Priority.java,  
somewhere where you can access them

2) Open a command prompt and go to the directory containing the files
for example:
	cd Desktop 

3) Compile the files that we will use by using the following command:
	javac Algorithm.java
	javac CPU.java	
	javac FCFS.java
	javac RR.java
	javac Priority.java
	javac Task.java
	javac Driver.java

4) Finally when they are all complied then run the program by 
using this command (the output should appear in the command prompt):
	java Driver [algorithm] schedule.txt

	where algorithm is either "RR", "PRI", or "FCFS"
