# Operating-Systems-Projects
Projects from CECS 326

## Description
This repository includes the work in my Operating Systems class which includes C and Java projects. Each project will include a READ.ME which provides instructions on how to run the program, a report demonstrating the design of the code and the necessary files to run the program. A Linux terminal was used in the fileCopy project in order for the program to work.
